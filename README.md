## Bank Loan Eligibilty Prediction ML Model
This is end-to-end machine learning model build using python's flask web framework for the deployment.

## Models used
- Logistic Regression - (83% accuracy)
    - with 80% accuracy on train data, and 83% accuracy on test data.
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) - (82% accuracy)
    - with almost the same accuracy as Logistic Regression. 79% on training and 82% on testing data.
- Random Forest Classifier - (Overfitting - 100% accuracy)
    - this model overfitted on training data. That's why I had remove this while deployment.
